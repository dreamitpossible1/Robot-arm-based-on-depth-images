## Project Title
A Robot Arm System for RB3 Gen2 Utilizing Depth Images


## Overview
This project develops a robot arm system for RB3 Gen2 using depth images. RB3 Gen2 serves as the core hardware platform, offering advanced motion control and sensor capabilities. Depth images enable the robot arm to perceive 3D environments for tasks like object recognition and grasping. The Qualcomm Intelligent Robotics Product SDK is utilized for efficient image processing and seamless integration with RB3 Gen2, enhancing the system's performance and reliability.
